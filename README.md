### Hi there, Meet Tolulade Ademisoye  👋


Here are some ideas to get you started:

Hi 👋🏽 I'm an Automation and Artificial Intelligence Engineer who loves solving complex problems in a simplified approach. Am also building at Reispar Technologies, an Artificial Intelligence & Enterprise ML startup in Lagos. Started out as an Industrial/Mechanical Engineer who specialised in Mechnaical, Power & Energy systems before going fully into Industrial & Automations.

I have a combined 8 years experience in Industrial & Enterprise Software systems, worked on a couple of Engineering Procurement Construction Intsallation & Modular projects during these years. Previously, led a startup (2018) in Lagos as Chief Operating Officer where I managed both engineeting and operations.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about vectors in NLP & ML model deployments in real-time.
- 💬 Ask me about Power systems, Machine Learning for Industrial Applications, how to set-up core data systems & structures for enterprises and lots more.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source and paid projects (i love building core applications for purpose-fit).
